Linear algebra is an extension of regular algebra as it is the study of vectors, matrices and linear functions and their tranformation properties. Matrices are two-dimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. If the array has m rows and n columns, we say that we have a matrix of size m√ón. Vectors are a special type of matrix or list of numbers that can either be a row (1xn matrix) or column (mx1 matrix). Linear algebra is foundational to data representation and computations in data science namely data preprocessing transformation and model Eevaluation; as well as machine learning for concepts such as dimensionality reduction and encoding.

The task was completed using Python in the linear_algebra.py file which contained the code the generate a range of X values and gives P which is the parameter vector. The aim of the task was to plot the graph f(x) = P.X; so the dot product of P and X. The desired output can be viewed as it is the image Figure_1.png
